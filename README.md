# POE Gauntlet Guide

## Introduction
I am Finest a POE player that is attempting to play Detonate Dead in the upcoming Krangled Gauntlet, this is for my personal use, however it is a nice thing to follow for leveling and the like. This allows me to quickly glance at some information while playing as fast as possible in the gauntlet. All of these things are merely suggestions, they are not hard and fast rules. The overleveling is to keep me as safe as possible so that I don't die to something because I stop paying attention for 0.2 seconds. The most important part of this is to get to 90 and to have fun!

## Leveling Zones (And How Far To Level)
Try to always be 8-10 levels higher than the zone

### Act 1
Submerged Passage (5) **(13-15)**  
The Ship's Graveyard (12) **(20-22)**

### Act 2
Southern Forest (13) **(23)**  
Wetlands (19) **(27-29)**  
Northern Forest (21) **(31)**

### Act 3
City of Sarn (23) **(33)**  
The Docks (29) **(37-39)**

### Act 4
The Dried Lake (34) **(42-44)**  
Kaom's Stronghold (38) **(46-48)**

### Act 5
Chamber of Innocence (43) **(51-53)**  
**THIS IS VERY DIFFERENT AT THIS POINT**  
Continue to level here to make sure you are at 105% Resists in everything **AND** 50-70 Life on each piece of gear.

### Act 6
The Ridge (46) **(54-56)**  
Southern Forest (49) **(57-59)**

### Act 7
Nothing to really do here, just be careful.

### Act 8
**IMPORTANT**  
This is when we want to begin thinking about endgame, we will be in the next zone for **WAY** longer.  
The Harbour Bridge (60) **(75-80)**

### Act 9
Again, nothing to really do here, as we are completely overleveled from Act 8.

### Act 10
Desecrated Chambers (65) **(80-90)**  
You can stay here until 90 to complete the gauntlet, but it may be more advantageous to have leveled to 80 in harbour bridge and just complete Act 10 than to overlevel anymore. Make sure you are again 105% Res on all resistances before leaving here though!
